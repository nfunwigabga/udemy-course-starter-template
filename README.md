### About
> This is a starter template for my Udemy Course on Course Marketplace. 

### Features
The template includes:
* A Laravel 8 with Vue.js SPA
* Vuetify for frontend framework
* Basic routing and middleware setup in the SPA.

The course starts with users pulling in this boilerplate. The Laravel (backend) setup is quite minimal, and only includes the route to serve the SPA. Everything else is then developed based on this.

### Usage
Clone the repo
```
git clone git@github.com:nfunwigabga/udemy-course-starter-template.git
```

Install the composer packages
```
composer update
```

Install the node packages
```
npm install
```

Compile the dev dependencies
```
npm run dev
```

Your script is now setup and ready to start the course.
